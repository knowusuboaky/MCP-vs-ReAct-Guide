# MCP Server vs ReAct Agent Loop

An **MCP server** *is similar in spirit* to a **ReAct agent loop**, but they sit at different layers.

---

## ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

**What it is:**
A prompting/agent pattern where an LLM:

1. Reads the user’s question.
2. **Reasons** about what tool to use.
3. **Acts** by calling that tool with arguments.
4. Reads the result, reasons again, and repeats until done.

**Key idea:**
The **LLM itself** is the “router” — it chooses which tool(s) to invoke.

## MCP Server

**What it is:**
A service that **exposes tools via JSON-RPC** (wrapped in FastAPI/Starlette, using SSE).

It doesn’t “think” or “choose.”
It just:

* Waits for a JSON-RPC call (`method = tools/call`, `params = {name: ..., args: ...}`).
* Finds the matching `@mcp.tool()` by name.
* Runs it and streams the result back.

---

## How They Connect

* The **MCP server** is the *toolbox*.
* The **ReAct-style LLM/agent** is the *brain* that decides which tool to pick and when.

So:

* If you only have the MCP server → it sits idle until *something else* (LLM client/agent) calls a tool by name.
* If you wrap that server with a ReAct LLM agent → now you get the reasoning loop on top, where the LLM autonomously picks and sequences your MCP tools.

---

## Analogy

* **MCP server** = a vending machine (all snacks/tools are labeled with exact codes).
* **ReAct** = a hungry person (LLM) who decides *which snack to pick* based on their craving (user query).

Would you like me to **expand this README with example code snippets** (one for the ReAct loop prompt, one for the MCP server JSON-RPC request) so it’s not just conceptual but also practical?
